# lncli

[![Build Status](https://drone.lys.ee/api/badges/Lyssieth/lncli/status.svg?ref=refs/heads/dommy-mommy)](https://drone.lys.ee/Lyssieth/lncli)

A CLI for reading Light Novels.

## Features

- home page with tracked LNs, with sorting options
- scrollable reading view with fancy plaintext
- search view that searches the website
- update checks for LNs

## Goals

The goal of this program is to both track updates and allow reading light novels, while having a simple-enough TUI.

## Future Additions

- Desktop Notifications (so if you leave it running, every ~1h or so it runs the update check and posts a notification)
- Native UI (ew, but maybe)
